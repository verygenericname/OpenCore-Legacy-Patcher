# Auto Patching's main purpose is to try and tell the user they're missing root patches
# New users may not realize OS updates remove our patches, so we try and run when nessasary
# Conditions for running:
#   - Verify running GUI (TUI users can write their own scripts)
#   - Verify the Snapshot Seal is intact (if not, assume user is running patches)
#   - Verify this model needs patching (if not, assume user upgraded hardware and OCLP was not removed)
#   - Verify there are no updates for OCLP (ensure we have the latest patch sets)
# If all these tests pass, start Root Patcher
